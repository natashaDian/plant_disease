# ðŸª´ Plant Disease Detection using CNN

## Description
A deep learning project for detecting plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and **EfficientNetB0** as a pretrained model. This system helps farmers and agricultural stakeholders to identify diseases early and reduce crop loss.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images from the dataset

- **Total Classes**: 15 types of plant diseases  
- **Images**: 20.000+ colored leaf images  
- **Format**: JPEG  
- **Structure**: Divided into training and testing sets
- **Here's the dataset after divided** (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PMB7Swf79PAKvc7aBw35CPzMgKAgWCCX?usp=share_link)
